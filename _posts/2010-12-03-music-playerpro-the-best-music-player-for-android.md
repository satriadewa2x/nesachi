  It is true that there are many music players for Android, but many who have tried I have really enjoyed, however, Music PlayerPro is a good player m√∫sica. This player has no equalizer function. For demanding a full-fledged poor but the sound is not unpleasant and is a player that can easily replace the default Android.

  Interestingly enough you can change the &#8220;skins&#8221; that is, change the configuration of the tabs, by Album, Artists, Genres and Folders. This above is a good option because this way we can configure our computer like the way your music library.
