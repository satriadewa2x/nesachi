  Foursquare is a service focused as a game, giving points and medals as you commenting and visiting sites, making use of GPS in your m√≥vil.Yo just install it on my Nokia N97.

  Users of Nokia phones as the 5800, N97, N97 and X6, in general all Symbian S60v5, ie the range touch and also the owners of models like the N95, N95 8GB, N82, E72, N86, etc. Also hear from our friends Goponygo this application already has long supported by the Nokia N900

  I have done the installation on a Nokia N97 Nini without problems, if someone installs it in another terminal appreciate your comments.

  With the official implementation we do check in on the places we visit, see the activity of our friends in the network or where they estado.Yo much truth do not control the network so appreciate all the comments on it for more advanced users . At least in Palma de Mallorca and in my neighborhood there are some comments on local-area. We see information about a place near where we are and see more information about them.

  To get it you just have to go to the Ovi Store and download it for free.
