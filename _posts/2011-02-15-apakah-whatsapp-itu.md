  When it comes to instant messaging are always talking about a protocol that is subject to a particular program or a particular platform, but this is where this application, WhatsApp enters and breaks the mold, and is not subject to any platform, and is available for different operating systems. Also if you have a data rate is free.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The philosophy is simple WhatsApp tries to follow, having a single program that you can talk to friends from the terminal regardless of operating system used, as it is available for <strong>iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Nokia Symbian</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Instructions for use<br /> The mechanics of starting this program is as simple as opening the program will ask you to introduce our phone number then we will send a text message from the program to your mobile phone and from there and just we will review the list of friends who already use WhatsApp and start sending messages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Posts<br /> Messages in this program may be sent to other users even if they are not online, either because they do not have the program open or do not have data coverage at the time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The messages can be text only or also can include anything from emoticons to images, videos, sound files, geographic locations related to google maps and contact information.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When it comes to attachments, you no longer need to have created earlier, we can capture an image at the same time and automatically attach to the conversation, from the same WhatsApp we are given this opportunity to choose to attach an image.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Similarly we want to ask how to attach audio files, allowing from existing files, to make voice messages at the same time thanks to the sound recorder that integrates the application itself. The other users only have to download the audio file and play it from the audio player of your choice.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If we are at a particular site and want to let you know a friend or simply recommend a local address we can send our location connected to Google Maps so you can join or visit the site at any time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Centralized communications<br /> From this program we can only send messages, you can access contact information, call the friend or send e-mail conversation to be recorded or can find a comfortable way at any time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Conclusion<br /> The comfort you can bring this program to communications can not be explained in a simple article, it is best to test the program for ourselves and from there we judge whether or not it is also clear that the comfort that can provide the program is the number of contacts that we already use it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Additional Information WhatsApp<br /> Type: Instant Messaging<br /> Size: 3.4 MB.<br /> Highlights: Interface simple introduction to using the program very intuitive picture attachments, simple video and voice<br /> Negatives: To start using the program is needed for sending a text message.
