  Youtube application Update that is ready for download on Android Market, which gives a complete facelift to the mobile version for this OS. New look, more in line with the overall aesthetics, enhanced search and above all, makes a winning application usability.

  The truth is that previous versions of the application, it fell short of Android, and at no time came to have the quality of the version &#8220;sister&#8221; for iOS, so we are looking forward to the appearance of this update. Now, you know, all updated.
