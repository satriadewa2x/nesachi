  It had been rumored for more than a week on an official application for Windows WordPress Phone 7, and finally announced. This completely free open source application, allows bloggers to do all common tasks such as we moderate comments, post or page write clearly, and check overall statistics. The good news is that it works on a blog hosted by us or on WordPress.com.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The idea is to offer WordPress by applying a series of tools that allow us to carry out the daily tasks of the bloggers, at any time and place, a very simple way, from a &#8220;view&#8221; from which we can control everything almost as if we were using WordPress from our computer. You just need to have an Internet connection and a phone with Android, and now joins those who already have available from BlackBerry and iPhone.
