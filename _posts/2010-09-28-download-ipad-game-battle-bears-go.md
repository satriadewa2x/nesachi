  I have a new game on my iPad moment is Battle Bears GO. It is a game which celebrates its first anniversary only, but that is terrible. I found it difficult to take in hand (even if it only takes 2 fingers to play, yeah, I know, but I&#8217;m not at all &#8220;console&#8221; me), but once the coordination between movements and the firing angle is found, it goes much faster.

  Goal: strafe other invaders teddy bear in a spaceship. Yeah, it&#8217;s fun, and it is (was?) Free. And you know how I know? Because I am a cochooon! No, I digress. Because I was advised a little likeable applied to identify all the free games on iPhone / iPad.
