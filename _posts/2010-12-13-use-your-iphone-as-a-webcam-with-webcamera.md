  While the iSight camera now called FaceTime, has become almost a standard in all Mac computer, often have the camera attached to a computer monitor or laptop allows little mobility of the same and few options to show something concrete than us themselves. And even now we can use the iPhone, thanks to FaceTime, almost like a webcam, best webcam to use it as a truth but with any application that we want to use and not only that Apple wants. For this we have an application in iTunes called WebCamera.
