  We all know that BlackBerry had managed to position itself well in the market, and is now moving beyond its focus on executives and entrepreneurs in need of such equipment, have become one of the phones of the moment. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going to start letting some tips on how to optimize your use, or as in this case customize it to make it truly unique.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Those who are already BlackBerry users probably have noticed that allows them to customize their icons so that its use is really comfortable and accessible to the needs of everyone, but something that many do not change, and should, because otherwise when a sound a BlackBerry phone everyone turns-are sound profiles, within which we can customize to taste the calls, e-mail alerts and text messages so that not all sound the same.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To begin the customization we need to select the sound icon always have the main screen, and once there we will have a choice between 7 different profiles of sound volume: Normal, High, Medium, Vibration, Silent, and All calls only Alerts disabled (the menu changes according to the language you have your mobile, but always the same profiles). The good news is that each turn can be customized, as well as the option we have to add ringtones, alerts, alerts for specific contacts and others.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To set a good example of how to edit these profiles, we will go step by step to customize one of them-in this case is normal, &#8220;but might be needing. First select Edit Profiles and then select Normal, once there we will see a list of categories to be customized. The first option is to change the ringtone for incoming calls, there is a long list of sounds that come preloaded on the BlackBerry phones, but also can select any MP3 song you really like it (for this we must select the option that is to the top of the list called &#8220;music&#8221; and search through our songs mp3 to find what we want to select it).

  bb101 full edit profiles BlackBerry Tips: Customize sonidoDentro profiles of the category of messages, we can also make a pretty interesting customization: assign each contact their own sound (either for SMS, MMS and the messages have Level 1 per set).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then there is the category of IM, we can customize the alerts for all instant messaging services we use, obviously the famous BlackBerry Messenger is also included in this category and would be more than interesting that people begin to customize the sound in particular, because sometimes indoors can be a sharp sound quite peculiar.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Following the categories, we are then with Reminders, they can be both tasks, calendar or whatever we put into monitoring.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The last category is &#8220;Other&#8221;, and where you can customize social applications, (actually the third), including Twitter and Facebook among others.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Once we have completely customized the profile to boot (remember that in this particular case we were customizing the Normal profile), we return to the menu&#8217;s and we can see the sound icon change as you have selected.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An extra tip: To change the profile quickly, such as when we need to put the phone on vibrate for some reason, we can do it easily by pressing and holding the letter Q up to open a pop-up that announces that it has changed vibration . To return to Normal profile that we only need to return to the letter press and hold Q until a new pop-up warning about the change.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This simple, and taking us a little time once, we can customize each and every one of the sound profiles that we have available on our BlackBerry and ensure that never again sound like anyone else and do not confuse us when we left home.
