With the flood of new iPhone users after this year, we get very simple questions to answer, but they are not as obvious to the newest in the world.

The way to make a backup of your iPhone is very simple and is done through iTunes.

  * Connect your iPhone to your computer via USB.
  * Open iTunes.
  * On the right side of the screen look for the icon of the iPhone and make you click the right mouse button.
  * Choose &#8220;Save Backup&#8221;

  Ok, wait a little to the process and you&#8217;re done. The backup keeps us virtually everything we have on our iPhone at the time, photos, SMS messages, Contacts, Mail, Applications. In fact if you buy a new iPhone, to synchronize with the backup will leave us just like the previous iPhone.

  To restore the backup in case we need it we have to choose the next option which we chose earlier, ie the Restore option.
