  The game has been downloaded over 45 million times from the App Store is now available for PC with <strong>Intel AppUp</strong>. The plot is quite interesting: it tells of a war between birds and pigs, the pigs have stolen the eggs of birds and the birds will want revenge on the enemy launched with a slingshot.

  There are several types of birds, all very angry, and we find them in the game as Avenza (105 stages, you want to play). There is what explodes, what is split, the one that snaps into the air, that drop bombs, there&#8217;s something for everyone. Obviously the smart pigs will defend itself with lard that we should just bring down to hit them. If we want to talk about the environments are very pleasing to look at all five, and at the end of each of them is a Boss, a beautiful oversized pig.

  The gameplay is really something special, do not play around too much or becoming addicted, seriously. E &#8216;taken care of in every way, from graphics tender and plump snowmen cartoons typical of the sounds and upbeat music. In the early levels you will be given the chance to experience the physics of the game, taking his hand in choosing the angle of the sling. Some may seem simple, but to complete all 105 levels and I assure you that there will.
