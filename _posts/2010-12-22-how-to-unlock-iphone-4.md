  A few days ago I wrote a tutorial on how to Jailbreak an iPhone 4-well, today we will unlock it. If the previous tutorial went well, you&#8217;ll like this more because it is infinitely more simple. All you need is to have the jailbroken iPhone, and follow these steps:
</p>

  1. Open Cydia
  2. Search ultrasn0w repository or add it manually: repo666.ultrasn0w.com
  3. redsn0w restart with (if you know how, take a look at the tutorial Jailbreak)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Tutorial finished, you have freed your iPhone to use the sim from the company that you like. If you have any problems, we refer to the section ultrasn0w the Dev-Team blog, where you can get a solution tailored to your needs.
