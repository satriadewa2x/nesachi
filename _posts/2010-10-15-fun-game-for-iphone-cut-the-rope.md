  To pass the time, here&#8217;s a little game for iPhone relaxing and makes us completely hooked from the first levels! After Angry Birds of the same company, it is not surprising that this second title is worth a mention for their game with the strongest growth in the App store from Apple. Try the free version for now fall under the spell of the little creature to eat green candy. Then $ 0.99 is worth the candle for hours.
