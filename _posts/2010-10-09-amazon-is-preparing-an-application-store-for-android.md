  Amazon, the largest bookstores in the world, aims to enter fully into the mobile software market. As they say in the Wall Street Journal, Amazon would be hashed out details for the launch of an Android application store. The newspaper claims a document that explains the conditions for developers, which among other things, includes applications in your shop can not be sold at a lower price anywhere else, and that Amazon will have exclusivity for at least two weeks ( assume that relate exclusively on Android, or may forget also have applications available on IOS). What is not known is whether this store is only for additional income or as part of the ecosystem to a possible tablet, and the family is sure to continue to grow Kindle.
