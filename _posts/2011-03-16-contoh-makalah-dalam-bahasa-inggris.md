<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Introduction<br /> Background<br /> Language is very important in human life. Language is means of communication. Without a language, a person cannot communicate with others. English is a language in the world. People call it a international language. In our school, the English language has been given since the fourth grade of the elementary school up to university.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Most people in the world from the different countries and nations speak language. Also, many scientific studies such as education, science, religion, technology, commerce or politic are written in the language.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Language includes four skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.<br /> Writing is language activity that needs much cognitive concentration. When writing, a writer is challenged to use just linguistics code without helping of other codes, take for instance, gestures. A writer has to arrange some ideas and transform them into his thinking carefully in writing codes on papers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In fact, writing is different from writing Indonesian. English as stated above is a foreign language for Indonesian student. English is a new language that they often have trouble when they learn it. One of the reason is the characteristics of English itself. For example, tenses, regular and irregular verb are not found in Indonesia. On contrary, Indonesia is a language which the students have got earlier basically, we believe that student of SMU have enough knowledge of it and have known to use it well and correctly. So it is possible that Indonesian, though it is a school language for most of them, can regard as the student’s mother tongue. They use Indonesian more frequently with they friends and teachers. Moreover, Indonesian is very close to them, to their speaking or writing habits. This is one thing that invites problems when the student writes the sentences composition in English.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Literature Review<br /> Each language has its sounds and meaning. But in fact, we find that each language also has specific characteristic, which are not found in the other languages. Even though Indonesia language and English language have similarities there are not language that are exactly the same.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

  Conclusion and Suggestion<br /> Conclusion<br /> Based on the collected and some points of view of several linguistics dealing with influence in acquiring and learning a second language, the writer would like to propose again the hypothesis that has been previously mentioned the different structure of the Indonesian and English sentence could possibly be the cause of influence in the students English composition. In accordance with hypothesis, the writer has concluded the research as follows:
</p>

  1. The influence of the Indonesian language as the first language of the second year’s students of SMAN I Ciawi has been noticed to appear in their written language, their short English Composition.
  2. The degree of influence which becomes a focus of this research is in the level syntax. The data of influence are taken from the short English composition of students including the sentences patterns, the use of simple sentence, complex sentence, compound sentence and compound complex.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Suggestion<br /> Based on research carried out, the writer would give my suggestion especially for those who are interested in the research of the same topic.
</p>

  1. The language teachers should know and understand language issues lika influence as this will have them facilities their students in Learning the second language. Therefore the teacher would be able to predict the problems that the students usually find in learning the language.
  2. The writer has handled the research of the influence in the level of syntax. As it is mentioned that influence might occur in the level of phonology, morphology. So, it is better if the others try to conduct the research on the other levels.
