  <strong>History</strong><br /> Blade of the Phantom Master was originally produced as a manga and manhwa series in 2001. It was released in South Korea and Japan Sinamhaengeosa Shin Angyo Onshi. The series was adapted into an animated feature film in 2004 in a rare collaboration between Japan and South Korea called Phantom Master: Dark Hero of the Empire in ruins.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>The Gist</strong><br /> There was a time when the Angyo Onshi or &#8220;Amen Osa&#8221; &#8211; Guardians of the people &#8211; were abundant and traveled the country of Jushin, killing the evil schemes and keeping residents safe. But now, all Angyo Onshi have disappeared, except one. Jushin has been destroyed. And he is back with a vengeance.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>The Review</strong><br /> Blade of the Phantom Master is the story of Ulsan, an &#8220;Amen&#8221; Osa &#8220;(&#8221; Angyo Onshi &#8220;in the Japanese version) &#8211; the last of a secret army created by the King of Jushin to protect the earth and its inhabitants.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Unfortunately, the army failed and fell Jushin, now devastated by the zombies, creatures and evil tyrants. Amid the collapse of Jushin, Ulsan falls into a state of unconsciousness and hovers between life and death. When retrieving, the King (also the best friend of Ulsan) is dead and Jushin is a mess. Ulsan essentially roams the earth in search of Aji Tae, the man he believes is responsible for the destruction of Jushin and the death of his friend.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There are, of course, a few plot twists in this story and although I&#8217;m not going to give everything, I&#8217;ll tell you Ulsan perhaps not exactly what he thought it was and no more than Jushin fell initially revealed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But what really makes the Phantom Master sheet so exciting is the level of action throughout the film. Ulsan is a Mahaia &#8220;in third place, which means you take the medallion has three horses and therefore carries some pretty amazing powers. The result is some very intense battles, including shootings, beheadings and even encounters with cannibalistic devil. It&#8217;s blood, is horrible and is definitely not for the Kiddos but if you want an anime that is &#8220;in-your-face, Blade of the Phantom Master is final.
