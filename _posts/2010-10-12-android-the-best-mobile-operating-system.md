  The new operating system born in the last scene of the proposals for smartphones has recently made great strides. Based on a linux kernel has been developed in full logic Open Source. In this respect, Google was able to buy as the confidence of the producers of so-called anti-iphone. But what are the features that make this unique operating system?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  First you need to consider multitasking. Mixed blessing epr smartphone operating systems if not properly developed and implemented this is likely to end up a problem rather than an asset. In fact the first real problem is the consumption of scarce energy resources that we have to keep open several applicaizoni although these can be managed by the processing power and ample supply of ram. While we can somewhat accept applications on smartphones monotasking multitasking or rose water. In a tablet we expect a real multitasking if this should somehow replace a laptop or a netbook anyway.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Also what should not be underestimated is the support to Flash. Recent Web applications are full, full of flash animations from the interactive multimedia advertising. An operating system that supports it is likely to end up like iOS4. If I&#8217;m satisfied, on the one hand, to navigate through the various web app, prefrisco navigate via the browser with a tablet. And if a meeting of an animated flash intro or something I think is a real limitaizone not be able to enjoy that content.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  That&#8217;s the war of operating systems including light gives way to the war between platforms. Flash over the years has built a multimedia platform, giving voice and spirit and a web in two dimensions. Suffice it to say that the same visualizzaizone movies on the web streaming is almost completely based on flash components to understand the scope of such a disruptive technology. Almost all major portals for sharing video and audio flash support without which they should go back to the time of year as Windows Media Player embedded Internet Explorer 6. For some flash content has become the lingua franca to appear intact and in different browsers on different operating systems. Avoid it could be a mess, and Android supports it but not avoid it in full.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Also look at the park applications available. Even if Android was delayed compared to iOS it is still catching up, especially in niche applications. The big problem with Android is, unfortunately, the poor quality of many applications. The fact that there is someone that valid applications in a timely manner means that applications made to circulate only evil that number and quantity, but to no avail. For charity is also populated by those iphone apps but the mere fact of being subject to a disciplinary publication makes the applicaizoni also due to be checked for quality. Surely someone will say that Apple deliberately censor some app not for purely technical reasons but for reasons of convenience and I think this is the big difference between the two systems. One armored and one fully open. The choice is also between two different philosophies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Finally, the reference hardware. There is no doubt that Android daily struggle for compatibility with any component, which does not happen on Ios. In an environment where devices are made with components from different manufacturers and features a different operating system has the high burden of having to adapt to a good amount of hardware failures, and of course could not miss. If we want is that we could do the same analogy between a PC and a mac. While a Windows operating system has always had to take account of the infinite availability of compatible hardware, the Mac has always been based on hardware already set up without regard to others.
