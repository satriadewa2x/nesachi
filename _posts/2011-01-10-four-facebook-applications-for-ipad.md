We analyzed 4 of the applications available on the App Store to access facebook from your iPad.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As the creators of Facebook have decided, for now, do not create a native application to access your network in the App Store have appeared for many applications that try to cover that iPad gap left by the official application. Among them stand 4 on all others, so let&#8217;s move on to submit:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Friendly announced recently that has been downloaded from App Store over 1.5 million users. The truth is that this is a great application you can access your facebook profile, you can browse through the profiles of your friends, comment on your walls, add links, and browse the photos that you have hung smoothly . It also has access to the facebook chat for those who will use it regularly. Friendly Application iPad is already available in the App Store for free.

  Friendly for Facebook &#8211; Oecoway Inc.<br /> Facepe made its appearance recently on the App Store, with much noise. This is another application to access facebook, but in which the display method is very different from the rest. It makes use of the three panels as in the official implementation of Twitter. The first panel is the menu shortcuts to the wall, your profile, photos, etc, etc, when pulsáis in one of those accesses are opened the second panel with the content you have clicked the link, and once there, if pulsáis for example in a video, open in the third panel. If you are accustomed to using in your iPad Twitter, I love this application, but surely you hate.

  FacePad &#8211; Facebook for iPad &#8211; Loytr<br /> Buddies is the answer for all that you use facebook mostly to share pictures and to see friends. Is fully oriented towards the usefulness of the network. Allows you to upload photos, comment, tag people in them, and the interface shows a mosaic of pictures that completely fills the screen. It also has a great chat service that connects to the facebook chat, and also serves as an independent chat between all that you have installed in your iPad Buddies, iPhone or iPod.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Buddies &#8211; Facebook Browser with Chat &#8211; Nick Kuh<br /> Facebook for iPhone is the last of the alternatives that we recommend. We can not forget that the facebook application developed for your brothers iPad is a great application because it is the closest thing to browse the network from its website, with almost all features a visual design equal to the web, and use very similar, and therefore a very fast learning. Also, the application is fast and fluid. The only bad thing is that if you do not have RetinaPad, you will see everything a tad pixelated.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Facebook &#8211; Facebook<br /> So you know, if you want access to your facebook profile from an application and not from the browser your iPad, these are the 4 possibilities on offer.
