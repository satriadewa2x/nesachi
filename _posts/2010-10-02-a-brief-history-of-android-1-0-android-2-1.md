  In July 2005, Google buys Android Inc., a small company based in Palo Alto, California, and then began to move beyond rumors that Google was planning to build its own free mobile phone and free to focus on advertising revenue in searches of people to move a little status quo in the mobile market. Obviously, those rumors were false a free mobile Android but ultimately turned out to be something much more interesting and revolutionary: an open source mobile operating system powered nothing more and nothing less than Google &#8230; so let&#8217;s review the history of Android.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The initial release of the Android Software Development Kit was released in November 2007, and well after mid-August 2008 &#8211; appeared in Android 0.9 SDK beta. The next month-end September 2008 &#8211; Android 1.0 SDK finally released (Release 1). Six months after the beginning of March 2009, Google introduced version 1.1 of Android for the &#8220;dev phone&#8221; and the update included some minor cosmetic changes as well as support for &#8220;voice search&#8221; paid applications on Android Market, the clock alarm arrangements , Gmail and other improvements.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In mid-May 2009, Google released version 1.5 of the Android OS (called Cupcake) with its own SDK which includes new features such as video recording, support for Bluetooth stereo system, customizable on-screen keyboard, voice recognition and AppWidget framework that allowed developers to create their own widgets to the page. Android 1.5 was the version that most people used to get started with Android (with T-Mobile G1 and HTC Dream in the U.S.) and still is a version that is available in many phones like the HTC Android Hero or several new MOTOBLUR like Motorola Backflip or Motorola Dexter.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then came Android 1.6 &#8220;Donut&#8221; in September 2009 with improvements in search, display and battery use to control VPN applet. In fact, this version was so good that all Android do not have a custom interface like HTC are now Motoblur Sense or 1.6, including the T-Mobile G1, and today remains the most popular version.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To take things further, the Droid Motorola (Motorola Milestone for us) was launched Android 2.0 &#8220;Eclair&#8221; which included several new features and even pre-loaded applications requiring a hardware much faster than the previous generation of phones with Android (a months later, went 2.0.1, a minor update).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Shortly thereafter, the Google Nexus One (which marked a before and after as Google tried to sell it yourself and release, as well as in some carriers) came with Android 2.1 (which some called &#8220;Flan&#8221; but Google is considering part of &#8220;Eclair&#8221;) with new 3D capabilities, live wallpapers and what it meant a major improvement from 1.6 platform. In fact, everyone is asking to be updated to 2.1 their own devices with Android, but it is likely that some may not work well all the features of this version.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Looking to the future of the platform, first Android Market app store is the fastest growing and reaching the 40 000 applications, operating system Android is the fastest growing in the United States almost beat iPhone, Motorola, together with Some other manufacturers are driving the landing in Latin America Android economic teams, and the other some complain about the fragmentation of the platform due to the different versions but the truth is that it is already starting to develop the know-how to provide updates to users in the future 2.1 and the following further that fragmentation is something that in the mobile world is almost inevitable.
