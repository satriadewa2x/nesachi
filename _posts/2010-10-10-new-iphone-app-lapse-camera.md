  Taking pictures at the same place at regular intervals, a slow to decompose, or witness the evolution of a subject is a common theme in photography. Lapse Camera proposes to assist the photographer in this process by providing the functions provided for this purpose. We can get superimposed on the screen the first shot of the sequence or the last (which is also convenient to indulge in the joys of stop-motion said it is not incorporated into the application itself ), and trigger an alarm to remind the rendezvous photo. Too bad Lapse Camera is priced at too high of 2.39 â‚¬.
