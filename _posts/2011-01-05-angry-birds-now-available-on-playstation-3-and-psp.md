  Angry Birds began his career as a game for iPhone. It had to release birds from structures nstruidas by evil pigs. So we could end up with their evil plans. This approach then jumped Android phones due to its great success. A success that continues to reap today and lets also go on sale in the current consoles. In fact later we see it in the other platforms.
