  Finally Blackberry begins to exploit the value of its user community and, personally, I think one of the best services for loyal users: the Blackberry Messenger becomes a social platform BBM Social Platform
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What does it mean for developers to access BBM?
</p>

First have access to a social platform and installed that everyone sees as a simple chat tool, but growing at 1.5MM new users per month (28 million active) and if you can connect your applications via APIs and create plugins &#8230;. have:

  * Contact list: your application can be viral with two clicks within a circle of trust &#8230; or just get to play across the world;)
  * BBM user profile user access status so you can use it as a marketing link (remember signing Hotmail)
  * Communities Application dedicated for this is great, you can create groups now, but creating &#8220;tied&#8221; to an application and to initiate action group is great.
  * Data Transfer &#8220;Needless to say that you can integrate this protocol into your application so they can send photos, audio, video and so on.?
