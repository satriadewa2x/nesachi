  Presenting himself as the real PhotoShop collage iPhone in terms of rotation effects and text, Mirage is a universal application for the less ambitious if we are to judge by the opportunities advertised rotation, perspective effects, ripple and strain images (fisheye totally customizable, for example), reflections under photos, coaching and work on masks.

  We already know the excellent Photo Wall Pro, sympathetic Photo Card Studio (which I will test soon) and the inevitable Diptic, now here comes a gas plant of its kind, sold a little expensive still, with a fixed price â‚¬ 2.39.
