But in the case of the iPhone 4 and its new features have led to the development team to create LuxyLight Sylion, an application that takes very seriously the use the phone as a light source and an example of how such a simple use as This can take care programs.

  Luxylight not only focuses on providing light when needed. Besides offering a way in which the light flashes like a strobe and another way in which the light used morse code to send a distress signal in case of emergency. Ideal for people who do sports or people in rescue situations, for example. And if we have to use the phone without worrying about touching any UI element, we can lock to be disabled, as we see in the image above.
