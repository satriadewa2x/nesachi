  And tomorrow is shaved gratis? It&#8217;s a bit what promises this new application, exclusively for iPhone and iPod Touch 4 4th generation: taking pictures in low light and make sure they are resplendent, as taken in daylight &#8230; A priori, the application takes several shots to optimize the final result, which suggests that the weight of the image is directly related to its quality. Remains that such &#8220;miracle&#8221; would require to be truly effective, a longer exposure time (because it is not by merging three dark images that obtains a properly exposed), and that the App looks a bit like a catcher iphoneographer &#8230; Especially that links to the site developer and online help are dead links.
