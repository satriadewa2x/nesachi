  SnapKeys calls it the keyboard without keys and has reached an agreement with PhilipsElectronics for marketing, according to company executives. Both income divided by halves. The success of the Apple iPad shows that people want more portable devices, SnapKeys said, giving as example the advertisements of various companies in this regard.&#8221;The market is shifting to mobile computers, so they are leaving the tablets&#8221;, they said.

  &#8220;We are in the process of reaching agreements. It will take several months to reach the market,&#8221; said CEO SnapKeys, Benjamin Ghassabian, who explained that the system works on all devices with Windows, Symbian and Android. &#8220;There is a fundamental problem when entering data on mobile devices,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The keyboards were made for fixed devices, not phones. And the screens are not meant to be a route of entry of data, but output,&#8221; he concluded.
