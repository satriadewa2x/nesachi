  Apps filters are not part of the most original of the App Store, and between photo fx, CinemaFX, Phototreats, Cool fx and other SwankoLab, the choice is already wide. That did not stop Audacity (which should be a replacement camera, Camera Flash and Zoom) to develop the Magic FX, offering more conventional filters (Sketch, posterization, Canvas SoftGlow, Watercolor &#8230;) and frameworks, and integrating usual settings (brightness, contrast), while providing a history prévisulation and cancellations, several effects can be cumulative. With its reduced price, the FX Magic could be interesting if she kept her promises to adjust the intensity of filters and save the photos in high resolution. FX Magic proposes to implement various conventional filters. Available at the App Store: Magic FX (0.79 €)
