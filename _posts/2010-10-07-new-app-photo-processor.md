  It does not go a month without a new photo editor application could see light on the App Store, but lately, we risk the traffic jam! After the Magic Picture Effect Monday, here comes Photo Processor, developed by an independent (Cheng Tao) which has no website (links on the App Store all point to Apple&#8217;s site).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This software is sold at the same price as Photogene (1.59 â‚¬), we strongly advise you not to refer you to this great value, rather than Photo Processor (whose functions seem to very increase of be kept to a minimum), unless you like the novelty and adventure &#8230; It is also possible to wait for a hypothetical free or low price to find this software in less risky.
