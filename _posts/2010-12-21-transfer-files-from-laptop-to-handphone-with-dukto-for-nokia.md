  This time we present an application for Symbian ^ 3 simple but very useful. Have you ever wanted to transfer files from your computer to your phone, but had no desire or time to connect? Then Dukto is an application that will interest you.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Basically, the application lets you transfer files using a Wi Fi connection between our phone and a computer, which can be either Windows, Mac or Linux. With Dukto can send and receive files, folders or any file from another device on the network. Simply run the application and select what you want to transfer, without requiring any installation on your PC.

  Either way, though not &#8220;need &#8220;to install software on your computer, it is best that we install the software Side show them down. File transfer is very fast, far surpassing the Bluetooth transfer to which, unfortunately Hermos we used to.

  Dukto is free, and all you need is to download the file from Ovi Store, along with the program for our desktop (if you want) and we&#8217;re ready to go. If you are transferring many files to their phones, definitely recommend it.
