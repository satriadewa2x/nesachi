  Wow &#8230; a decade is almost over. And what a decade it has been! We have seen a variety of new anime in the last ten years &#8230; some good, some bad and others it was absolutely amazing! So, which anime titles we flew in the 2000s? Here&#8217;s my top picks from the list.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>1. Naruto</strong><br /> Based on the manga by Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto is the story of a young ninja, motivated to learn that he is actually a vessel of a dark and evil force, the demon of nine tails Fox This evil entity was captured by a leader the village when Naruto was just a baby. The leader was the devil to Naruto baby and then died &#8211; people from the village Naruto blame for this loss. Naruto embarks on a quest of self-discovery, hoping to become the leader of the people next door, called Hokage. Naruto debuted in Japan in 2002 and again in the U.S. in 2005 through the Cartoon Network Toonami programming.

  <strong>2. Bleach</strong><br /> Based on the shonen manga series written by Tite Kubo, Bleach is the story of Ichigo Kurosaki, a young man who accidentally acquires the powers of a shinigami. Like the more familiar &#8220;Grim Reaper&#8221;, a shinigami must help the souls to the afterlife, but they have other responsibilities as well &#8211; which should protect humans from evil spirits. The anime began airing in Japan in 2004. VIZ Media acquired the rights in North America and brought Bleach for the states in 2006 on Cartoon Network&#8217;s Adult Swim programming block.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>3. Afro Samurai</strong><br /> With the voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Afro Samurai is based on the graphic novel by Takashi Okazaki and tells the story of a lone samurai who wants a little revenge for the death of his father. For this vengeance, of course, must travel the land, making friends and enemies along the way. Jackson co-produced the series and is without a doubt one of the best releases of anime you&#8217;ll find in this decade. Distributed by FUNimation, the series premiered on Spike TV in 2006 and hit DVD shelves in 2007.

  <strong>4. Death Note</strong><br /> Based on the manga by writer Tsugumi Ohba and artist Takeshi Obata, Death Note is the story of a young student who finds a mystical book that gives the power over life and death. The decision to rid the world of some of its less desirable elements, it starts to use the book to &#8220;downgrade&#8221; the criminals. But it&#8217;s not long before the infamous detective L decides to track down the vigilantes. Death Note was released in Japan in 2006 and lasted 37 episodes.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>5. Black Lagoon: The Second Dam</strong><br /> Black Lagoon: The Dam The second is the ongoing story of the Lagoon Company, a group of mercenaries piracy and adventure trip on the road. This anime series is definitely a freaky and creepy collection so be careful: this is not for the faint of heart. That said, is one of my favorites and has a knack for making you want &#8220;more.&#8221; Since &#8220;freaky&#8221; is not an official genre, may classify this as a psychological action thriller. Black Lagoon: The Second Dam debuted in the U.S. in 2008 after a career in Japan in 2006.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>6. Hellsing</strong><br /> Hellsing is the story of a vigilante group of vampires &#8211; the Hellsing Organization &#8211; and his target, Millennium, a mysterious Nazi organization that specializes in creating artificial vampires. Created by Gonzo and rReleased in Japan in 2001, Hellsing did not hit the U.S. until much later &#8211; 2006.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>7. Fullmetal Alchemist</strong><br /> Released in Japan in 2003 and then in the U.S. the end of 2004, Fullmetal Alchemist is based on the manga by Hiromu Arakawa the same name and ran for 51 episodes.The story of two brothers &#8211; Edward and Alphonse Elric &#8211; Fullmetal Alchemist leads us into a fantastic science fiction where the journey is reached learn all about the principles of alchemy and see first hand what happens when you do not obey.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>8. Mushi Shi</strong><br /> Although there is a kind of edge of your seat story, Mushi-Shi Anime makes my list because the Decade of the stories are so original and most importantly, the animation is quite lovely Unlike most sample of anime, Mushi-Shi not exactly have a plot underway with the caveat that our Ginko narrator is a drifter who can see the mushi &#8220;- supernatural entities &#8211; and moves around trying to minimize the havoc they cause in the human world. But beyond that a bit constant, each episode is a stand-alone story, with beginning and end, something I find refreshing in the midst of so many stories that continue for 200 + episodes.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>9. Gungrave</strong><br /> This supernatural thriller is adapted from a video game Gungrave and debuted in Japan in 2003. It was acquired by Geneon Entertainment and was part of the release agreement with FUNimation 2008. The story of Brandon Heat and his life after avenging death, Gungrave is creepy, bloody impressive and, therefore, rated &#8220;M&#8221; for mature audiences.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>10. Darker than Black</strong><br /> This press post-apocalyptic debuted in Japan in 2007 and then click each state through the end of 2008 DVD. The story of a futuristic Earth where, apart from an odd address &#8220;distortions&#8221; in the atmosphere, there is also a new breed of human called contractors. These contractors have a number of different powers and abilities and the like used for a variety of reasons, some good and others as well .. not so good. The series was created by Tensai Okamura and produced by Studio Bones &#8211; in an interesting note, unlike most anime titles, the manga was not created until after the anime.
